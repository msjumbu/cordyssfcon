/**
 * \brief Class describing an XML Schema type.
 *
 * Each element and attribute is assigned a type. In both cases, the type
 * may be a simple one, but it can also be a complex one for elements,
 * which means that its sequence contains child elements with other types.
 * In all cases, simple types may be restricted by several facets.
