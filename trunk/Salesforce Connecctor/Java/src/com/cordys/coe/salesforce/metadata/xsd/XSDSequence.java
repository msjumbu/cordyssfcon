/**
 * \brief Class describing an XML Schema sequence.
 *
 * Sequences are used to hold one or more elements as children of an
 * existing XML Schema element.
 * Objects of type \ref XSDSchema are special sequences which do not have
 * a parent element, but can contain a list of attributes in addition to
 * elements.
 * Other special sequences are element groups and attribute groups. Both
 * will have their group name or reference set (see \ref getGroupName
 * and \ref getGroupRef), and can be distinguished by testing
 * \ref getGroupAttribute.
