/**
 * \brief Class describing an XML Schema tree.
 *
 * Most of the time, only one object of this type exists in the application,
 * but its child elements expand to a whole XML schema tree representation.
 * All of the \ref XSDSequence methods are also applicable to objects of
 * this type, but not all of them make sense.
 *
 * For all schema access levels (see \ref XSDParser on how to build XSDSchema
 * objects), the schema definitions can be retrieved. The methods for this
 * are \ref getTypes, \ref getGroups, \ref getAttributes and \ref getElements,
 * the latter two being from \ref XSDSequence.
 * Types include both simple and complex types, and groups include both
 * attribute groups and the element groups referenced in choices.
 *
 * In case of non-resolved included files (i.e. in access level "flat"),
 * the methods \ref getIncludes and \ref getImports return the locations
 * of the referenced files. This information is used by \ref XSDTransformer
 * for augmenting the level.
